Regional Insights Through Tableau: Evaluating Strengths and Weaknesses Using World Bank Indicators

The project aims to use Tableau to analyze and visualize regional data from the World Bank Indicators dataset. By focusing on two regions, the objective is to uncover strengths and weaknesses across four categories of measures, compare their overall performance, and provide actionable recommendations to address identified challenges.

Key Features:

1. Highlight strengths and weaknesses for each region (4+ worksheets each).
2. Compare overall regional performance and justify findings.
3. Provide actionable recommendations based on insights.
4. Present the analysis as a cohesive Tableau story.
